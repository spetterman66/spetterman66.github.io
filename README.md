# windows 8 will never die!
a beautiful website made to look like the windows 8 metro interface. 
even though windows 8 was hated by many, its metro design was influential and ahead of its time. it helped the world transition away from skeuomorphism and into flat design.  
lowercase text is intentional.

(if not on windows, install the font "segoe ui" for the best experience.)

feel free to fork this repository and make use of this unique design in your own projects.
