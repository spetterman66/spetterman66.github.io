a beautiful website made to look like a windows 8 metro interface.
do not raise an issue about the text not being capitalized, it is intentional.
(mac and linux users are welcome to use this website, but it is optimized for windows 8+ users, unless you can find a copy of the Segoe UI font).
this website is not affiliated with microsoft, windows, or any of their products.
