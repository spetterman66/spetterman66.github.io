<body>
    <p>If overclocked by a bit, the MSI NVIDIA 8400 GS is still usable in 2024.</p>
    <p>All games are ran at the lowest possible setting through the GUI, not through special command-line arguments or configuration files.</p>
    <h2>clocks the card in this setup runs at:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>core/shader: 750MHz</li>
        <li>memory: 800MHz</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>game benchmarks:</h1>
    <h3>Holocure (cool Hololive Vtuber game on Steam)</h3>
    <p>runs at a good 45-65FPS, due to it being a simple 2D pixel art game.</p>
    <h3>Half-Life 2</h3>
    <p>runs at 35-50 FPS, due to the game being old xd</p>
    <h3>Portal 2007</h3>
    <p>runs at quite a smooth 45-60FPS :D</p>
    <h3>Minecraft 1.12.2</h3>
    <p>with the fastest settings and 10 render chunks to keep my sanity, it runs at a comfortable 20-30FPS.</p>
    <h3>Osu!</h3>
    <p>due to the game being 2D, this rather bad graphics card handles it well, as its good at 2D acceleration. 50 to 90 FPS, depending on intensity of beatmap.</p>
    <h3>Unigine Heaven</h3>
    <p>the Unigine Heaven benchmark runs at a maximum of 7fps on a resolution of 1600x900, maybe it'll run faster on a lower screen resolution.</p>
    <h3>VRChat Desktop</h3>
    <p>VRChat Desktop runs at 10fps maximum on 1280x720, with the "Planck Zero" world (smallest possible world in VRChat, so it doesn't take up a lot of resources at all)</p>
